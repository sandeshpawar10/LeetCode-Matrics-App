🚀 LeetMatric – LeetCode Progress Visualizer

LeetMatric is a **JavaScript-based dashboard** that visually displays a LeetCode user’s problem-solving progress using interactive progress circles and statistics cards.  
This project was built to **understand real-world JavaScript concepts**, API usage, and frontend–backend interaction.

✨ Why I Built This Project

As my **first serious JavaScript project**, I wanted to go beyond simple DOM manipulation and learn:
- How real websites fetch data
- How APIs and GraphQL work
- How to handle errors, async code, and UI updates
- How frontend and backend communicate

LeetMatric helped me gain **hands-on experience** with all of these concepts.

⚙️ How It Works

1. First start the server by doing **npm run dev** in the terminal, it will start your server
2. User enters a LeetCode username
3. Frontend sends a request to a **local Node.js server**
4. Server fetches data from **LeetCode GraphQL API**
5. Data is processed and sent back to frontend
6. UI updates dynamically with progress circles and stats
